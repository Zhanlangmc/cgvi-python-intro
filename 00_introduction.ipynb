    "\r\n",
    "You can view and run these notebooks in a variety of ways. One way is to type `$ jupyter notebook` into a terminal with python and jupyter installed. This will start a local jupyter notebook server, and open a page in your web browser. From here you can select the `.ipynb` notebook file you would like to view.\r\n",
