    "The code for this introductory course will be provided in the form of Jupyter notebooks. These are files which can contain a mixture of python code and text, written in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) format.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "You can view and run these notebooks in a variety of ways. One way is to type `$ jupyter notebook` into a terminal with python and jupyter installed. This will start a local jupyter notebook server, and open a page in your web browser. From here you can select the `.ipynb` notebook file you would like to view.\r\n",
