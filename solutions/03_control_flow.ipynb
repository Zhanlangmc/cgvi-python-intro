    "\n",
    "This follows a very simple update rule - the first two terms are:\n",
    "\n",
    "`f_0 = 0`\n",
    "\n",

    "`f_n = f_n-1 + f_n-2`\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a script to generate all Fibonnacci numbers under 100 using a `while` loop. Then use a `for` loop to print the first 21 Fibonnacci numbers. Print each number in turn. You can use the table on [the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) to check your code is correct."
