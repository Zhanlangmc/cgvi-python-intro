    "### Exercise: Comma Separated Value Files\n",
    "\n",
    "You now know how to write text strings to a file. One very long-lived, but still very useful format for data are [Comma Separated Value (CSV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) files. These can store tables of data, and are still supported by modern spreadsheet software (LibreOffice Calc, Excel, Google Sheets, Numbers etc.). They're often a good way to quickly save some data from a python script and later load it and process it in a spreadsheet program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The format of CSV files is super simple. They're just text files, and each entry in the table is separated from the next by a special character (usually a comma `,` or a semicolon `;`). Lines of the table are separated by newline characters. Here's a quick example:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "Time, Temperature <br>\n",
    "0, 20 <br>\n",
    "1, 24 <br>\n",
    "2, 25 <br>\n",
    "3, 26 <br>\n",
    "4, 24 <br>\n",
    "</code>"

    "Try saving some data about the performance of your current machine (CPU usage, memory usage etc.) to a CSV file, and then load it in Excel, or your software of choice.
